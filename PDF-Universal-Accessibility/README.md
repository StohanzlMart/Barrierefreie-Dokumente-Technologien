# PDF/UA for accessible documents

Disclaimer: Ich habe nix mit PDF oder PDF-Assoc. zu tun!

> In this ISO standard "UA" stands for universal accessibility. PDF/UA defines how texts, images, forms and other content must be created so that people with disabilities - and machines - can use them. PDF/UA helps organizations meet legal requirements for providing access to electronic information - for example in public institutions, insurance companies and banks.

> Overall, PDF/UA begins with many requirements similar to those of PDF/A-2u. In addition, the ISO standard for accessible PDF includes requirements for representation of document structure; headings, paragraphs, columns, tables and alternative texts for images encoded in the “tagging structure” of a PDF file. Automatic, subsequent generation of document structure information is time-consuming, so PDF/UA generation usually begins at the original document.

> PDF/UA can also be seen as the successor to the conformance level "A" from PDF/A. Of all the PDF standards discussed in this article, PDF/UA places the highest demands on generation and always requires human interaction.

# Um sicherzustellen, dass ein Dokument auch PDF/UA konform werden kann, sind folgende Schritte notwendig

* Information mit \*Dekoratoren\*
  * auf der Tastatur geschrieben
    * mit LaTeX 
    * MS Office
    * Open Office
    * Markdown
    * XML
  * Gesprochen
  * Gestikuliert
  * Myokuliert (Kommuniziert durch sonstige Muskelbewegungen) #todo besseres Wort finden
* Bits konvertiert (hoffentlich zu PDF/UA unter anderem...)

# Um bei der Konvertierung gute PDF/UA Konformität zu erzielen, bieten die Werkzeuge verschiedenste Routen.

Im Folgenden sind möglichst ALLE Routen ALLER Dokumentformate aufgezählt.
